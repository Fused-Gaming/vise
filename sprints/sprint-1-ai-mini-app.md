## Tips for Success

1. **Start Simple**: Build MVP first, add features later
2. **Test Your Prompts**: Iterate on prompt quality
3. **Handle Errors**: API calls can fail - plan for it
4. **Version Control**: Commit frequently with clear messages
5. **Ask for Help**: Use Discord and office hours
6. **Document as You Go**: Don't leave docs for the end
7. **Test Early**: Deploy early to catch issues
8. **Get Feedback**: Show your work to peers regularly

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Scope Creep**: Don't add too many features
- **Poor Error Handling**: Always handle API failures
- **Inadequate Testing**: Test edge cases and errors
- **Missing Documentation**: Write docs as you code
- **Last-Minute Deployment**: Deploy early and often
- **Hardcoded Secrets**: Use environment variables
- **Ignoring UX**: User experience matters
