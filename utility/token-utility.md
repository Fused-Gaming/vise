- Slashed stake burned
- Unclaimed rewards (after 2 years) burned

**Target**: Slight deflation (0.5-1% per year) after year 3

---

## Staking & Rewards

### Staking Mechanics

**Staking Contract**: Non-custodial, on-chain

**Lock Periods**:
- Flexible: Unstake anytime (no rewards)
- 30 days: 5% APY + 1.2x governance multiplier
- 90 days: 10% APY + 1.5x governance multiplier
- 180 days: 15% APY + 2x governance multiplier

**Compound Options**:
- Auto-compound rewards
- Claim rewards separately
- Partial unstaking (flexible tier only)

### Reward Calculation

```
Rewards = (Amount Staked × APY × Days Staked) / 365

Governance Multiplier = 1 + (Lock Period Bonus)
```

**Example**:
- Stake: 10,000 VISE
- Period: 180 days
- APY: 15%
- Rewards = 10,000 × 0.15 × 180 / 365 = 739.73 VISE
- Governance Multiplier: 2x

### Staking Rewards Source

**Revenue Sources**:
1. Platform transaction fees (50% to stakers)
2. Course fees (30% to stakers)
3. Audit/consulting fees (40% to stakers)
4. Partnership revenue (25% to stakers)
5. Treasury investments returns (distributed quarterly)

**Reserve Pool**:
- 5M VISE reserved for staking rewards subsidy
- Used in early phases before revenue scales
- Governed by community
